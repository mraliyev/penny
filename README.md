# Sign In/Up [Angular, NgRx, NestJs, TypeORM, SQLite]

This application offers a user-friendly sign-in and sign-up process, following best practices. It checks in the background to see if a user is already registered and suggests logging in instead of creating a new account, enhancing user experience and efficiently managing credentials.

## Run project

To run the fontent server, use:

```sh
npx nx serve frontend
```

To run the backend server, use:

```sh
npx nx serve backend
```

After running above commands the app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

The project uses `sqlite` as a db. It automatically creates the `database.sqlite` in the local folder.

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve frontend
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build frontend
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project frontend
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
